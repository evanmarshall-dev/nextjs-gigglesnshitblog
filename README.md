# Giggles N Shit --Blog

This is a blog written by me, Evan Marshall, owner of [Elysian Web Design](https://elysianwebdesign.com/)

It is a narration of my introduction into the wonderful world of parenting. We get our fair share of curve balls thrown at us, but we always get through it as a **team**.

## Life is Funny

No matter what the situation --be it screaming babies, surprise shits or judgmental parents; I always seem to have a knack for seeing the _humour_ in each situation. This blog is my gift of humorous stories for you!

## The Nerdy Stuff

The blog is a web app created using the [Next JS React Framework](https://nextjs.org/), Markdown (MDX) text for data input as well as [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for the core styling.
